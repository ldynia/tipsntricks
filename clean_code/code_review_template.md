# Objectives

Objective of this document is to create a set of recommendations that will help the team in coding and DevOps activities.

# Implementation

Execution of the recommendations is up to the team. It’s to be highlighted that the team can get help from the assessor.

# Artifacts and Metadata

- Review Date: 27 July 2022
- Assessor email: abcd@gmail.com
- Reviewed repository link: Link To Repository
- Reviewed repository branch: master
- Reviewed repository commit: 908fce5e4dbe652371ca08b237b71cffeef2dd70

# Notes

- Assessor/Reviewer doesn’t know the team and context. 
- Assessor/Reviewer assess artifacts (source code / pipelines) as they are found (written/seen). 
- Assessor/Reviewer assumes that pointed elements found in the artefacts might be replicated in other repositories of that team.
- Recommendations are created based on the work found in repository indicated by branch name and commit that it refers to as well as the ADO pipelines of that team.
- Recommendations are written with two colours BLACK and BLUE. Black colour answers WHAT question. Blue colour, answers WHY question. Example: Hardcoded passwords MUST be removed from the source code and git repository. Because they might lead to critical information bridge, and more likely will contribute to wrong developers’ culture within the team.
